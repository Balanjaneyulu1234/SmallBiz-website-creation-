Here's how you can approach the given business case step-by-step:

---

### **Solution Design and Development**

1. **Planning and Requirements Analysis**  
   - Identify the small business (e.g., bakery, consultancy, or retail shop).  
   - Outline the structure:  
     - **Home Page**: Introduction, key services, and a call-to-action (e.g., "Contact Us").  
     - **Contact Us** Page: Contact form (fields like Name, Email, Message), business location map (using Google Maps API if required), and contact details.  
   - Define the design requirements: responsive layout, consistent branding, and accessibility.

2. **Technologies and Tools Used**  
   - **HTML5**: Structure and content of the website.  
   - **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and responsive adjustments.  
   - **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Interactivity (e.g., form validation).  
   - **Bootstrap**: Grid system and reusable UI components for responsiveness.  
   - **jQuery**: Simplified DOM manipulation and event handling (if necessary).  
   - **Hosting**: Use GitHub Pages for hosting the live demo.  

3. **Design and Development Process**  
   - Create a **wireframe or mockup** of the website to visualize the layout.  
   - Use **Bootstrap Grid System** to ensure responsiveness across devices.  
   - Style the website with CSS to match the brand identity of the business.  
   - Test the layout on different screen sizes and devices (e.g., Chrome DevTools).  

4. **Responsive Design Techniques**  
   - Use **media queries** in CSS to adapt the layout for various screen sizes.  
   - Utilize Bootstrap classes like `container-fluid`, `col-`, and `d-flex` for responsiveness.  
   - Optimize images using tools like TinyPNG and define dimensions with relative units (`%, vh, vw`).  
   - Test the navigation menu for usability on mobile devices.  

5. **Challenges and Solutions**  
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring form validation worked consistently.  
     **Solution**: Used JavaScript for real-time validation and fallback server-side checks.  
   - **Challenge**: Designing for multiple screen sizes.  
     **Solution**: Tested iteratively on multiple browsers and devices to refine media queries.  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Push the source code to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages for live hosting.  
   - Share the live demo link in the documentation.

### **Deliverables**
1. **Source Code**  
   - Organize all files into `index.html`, `css/`, `js/`, and `assets/` folders.  

2. **Additional Resources**  
   - Include images, fonts, or icons in the `assets/` folder.  

3. **Documentation**  
   - Include a brief document describing:  
     - Design and development process.  
     - Challenges faced and how they were resolved.  
     - Explanation of responsive design techniques used.  
     - Lessons learned and best practices followed.  

4. **Live Demo**  
   - Provide a live demo link hosted on **GitHub Pages** (e.g., `https://<username>.github.io/<project-name>`).

### **Key Takeaways for the Candidate**
- Document the process thoroughly to demonstrate a clear understanding of responsive web development.
- Highlight examples of responsive design (e.g., screenshots of the site on different devices).
- Ensure the live demo link works as expected before submission.
